\chapter{Contribution to Knowledge}
This research focuses on the research questions about the privacy issues on Graph Search and solve it by designing a cryptography based privacy preserving scheme for Graph Search with rich search functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the above issue and provide a feasible solution for it. To enable the search functions over a encrypted graph, a service that supports secure and efficient boolean queries is proposed, and this service will be extended to support necessary functions for Graph Search. A formal security analysis will be given to verify the security performance of this scheme. Once the new scheme is fully defined, the scheme will be deployed in a distributed system, and subjected to intensive evaluation. The evaluation assesses the scheme's efficiency by collecting the queries delays and measuring the overhead from cryptography under a large dataset. The evaluation will play a important role to justify the practicability of the proposed scheme.
