\chapter{Objectives and Methodology}
As mentioned in the literature review, this research plans to contribute in the field of Searchable Graph Encryption by proposing new Graph Encryption scheme with rich search functions, and protect OSN users' privacy in Graph Search by using the above scheme. The detailed objectives and the methodologies are summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Searchable Graph Encryption Model:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Abstract the graph model from social graph
\item Induct cryptography into the graph model
\item Apply secure index on encrypted graph structure
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Search Functions for Graph Encryption:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Support boolean queries in Graph Encryption
\item Support complex operators in Graph Search
\item Security notation and analysis of search functions
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Deployment on Large Scale Graph}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Implement the search functions as privacy preserving schemes
\item Deploy scheme into large scale graph to simulate Graph Search
\item Evaluate the efficiency and usability of simulated Graph Search via our scheme
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The methodologies of this research are basically the abstraction and modelling from real world, inducting and developing new concepts and protocols based on the model, implementing and evaluating the model in the real world cases.
