Social networks are growing in leaps and bounds for many years, and more and more people use social network as their common tool for communication and interaction with others. Using the social network service generates a huge amount of data relating to users' behaviour, preference and so on. As a result, social network providers started to make those data searchable by introducing ``Graph Search'' to improve the search experience of their services. However, such data always contain users' sensitive data like their name, address, photo, etc., making those data searchable leads to increasing privacy concern. This research aims to make contributions for protecting users' privacy in the context of Graph Search. It introduces a new model to enable searchable encryption on Graph Encryption, and private search functions will be proposed and analysed to support rich search functions in above model. It also implements the search functions into privacy preserving scheme for Graph Search, and evaluation the schemes on a cloud scenario. This research improves users' privacy while using Graph Search service and is practical to deploy in the large scale distributed system.
